# Results Notes

#### Run Info

This was a 2 site run in COINSTAC UI with a pipeline set up to reflect the settings on the current repo inputspec. 

#### Results Info

All the files are generated and placed in a single site's output folder.

Due to the large package size, the example result files can be found here: [Link](https://mygsu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/spanta_gsu_edu1/Documents/COINSTAC_comps_test_results/enigma_sans?csf=1&web=1&e=8sJi5s "Link")

Currently, UI does not generate any result info on the UI screen, the user must click on the Open Local Results button to view the subsequent files.
